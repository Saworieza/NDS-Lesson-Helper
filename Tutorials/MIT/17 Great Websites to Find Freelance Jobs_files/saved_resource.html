<p>When I started working on oDesk years ago, things were different. There weren't all these jobs that said "I need 10 PERFECT articles with FLAWLESS grammar in the next hour, and I'm willing to pay $1 to get them done!" The site seems to have gone to crap over the years, probably because of its increased popularity. I rarely use it now, and if I do, it is because someone has reached out to me  on there. I have found a couple pretty good oDesk jobs in the past year or so, but I only got them because I had killer feedback and proof that I knew my stuff (which I do...lol). If Elance has in fact become superior, it wouldn't surprise me.</p>

As of now, Odesk really has jobs that are way below the minimum rate even for developing countries (I am an Indian and I can vouch for that).</p><p>Even the demand for great content has been steadily increasing thanks to every animal-named Google update ( Hummingbird being the recent one), many clients still seem to be looking to buy the world for $1.</p><p>Elance and Guru seem to be marginally better, of course.

<p>Hopefully some days a few international laws will be drafted and passed that will engage oDesk's leaders responsability towards allowing such economical slavery schemes to happen. Of course the concept of minimum wages differs from one corner of the world to another, it does, but there has to be some limits or some framework to act from. Shameless, disgraceful employers abound from everywhere  it seems, and oDesk provides them with just the honeypot they came for...</p>

<p>I was going to keep quiet about this, but I just don't think I can. You talk about oDesk workers as if they are being forced on the computer against their will. They don't *have* to work online, especially if it is not providing them with proper job security. They also don't *have* to settle for low paying jobs. I certainly don't. If a person chooses to work for pennies an hour, that is his choice. Maybe that is more than what he would make working 9-5 somewhere else. oDesk can't be held responsible for that, just like Craigslist can't be responsible if someone pays $200 for an item worth $20 that he saw on a classified ad. Is it fair? No. But it's far from "economical slavery."</p>

<p>Well then, you should have kept quiet about this because if in theory you might be right, in practice it's a total different story, even if i admit a very small minority seem to do not too bad. In reality, things just don't happen the way you describe them. Your arguments are insulting to anyone who has no choice but to keep taking low paying jobs while desperately looking for something better. Let me do a bit of history here. Once, when rentacoder(now vworker) was starting, the bids were public, and the result was people got very low in the way they behaved, say like proposing 5$ for a project that was worth 500...so rentacoder decided after a month and a half to make bids private so contractors could not see what others bid anymore. What i am getting at here, is that, people don't actually dream/choose to work for low paying assholes, they're just brainwashed into believing they'll make it this way, that the competition is stiff but they'll manage somehow, to some level and at some point. It's called mental masochism, and oDesk like many others are just exploiting that. Of course people are free of their choices, and can always decide to land better gigs, but sometimes the wallet says otherwise. Being a starting freelancer can be extremely hard, regardless of your level of expertise in what you provide, it's up to the reader to decide how much of what i am saying is right, and as for me i'm glad i know what it's all about and can put it behind. Let new starting freelancers find out at their own expense...</p>

<p>There is no reason for you to get so worked up. In no way am I promoting the idea of people working for "low paying assholes." The point I was trying to make is that people don't have to be freelancers period. They don't have to work online, especially if they are being underpaid. If they are making significantly less than minimum wage on the internet, they can go to McDonald's, find a job, and pick up work online whenever something comes around worthy of their time. I only moved to full-time work online when it became more profitable than what I was doing at the time, and then more profitable than the degree I was pursuing.</p><p>I'm not insulting anyone. I'm saying that under no circumstances are there writers, programmers, data entry experts, and other internet workers with guns to their heads as they type away. We all choose this kind of career, and we take the good with the bad. If it turns out to be a poor decision, it's our job to figure out whether we need to go elsewhere. This applies to any career, even outside of the internet. The majority of us aren't given great opportunities from the start, and most change careers a few times in life before finding something that works for them. Even I have done that with a freelancing career - I'm still doing it to this day. At the end of the day though, I know I there isn't anything stopping me from stepping away from the computer and going out into the real world.</p>

<p>okay i sort of see your point better now, but can't help thinking it's not so simple, partly because most people working freelance don't do that good socially in a normal job and seem to be a quite isolated socially anyway, so even if i think i understand what you're saying, it's probably not every freelancer that can deal with things this way, with an open and daring mind</p>

<p>That I agree with. I convinced a family member of mine to "do what I do" because she was struggling to work in the hustle and bustle of society. In that case, it can be difficult to deal with the fact that most freelance jobs don't pay well - especially if you don't have experience. If you're good at what you do though, you manage to get through it. I did, she did, and several of my colleagues did as well. Leave the crappy jobs for the crappy workers, and commit to finding the jobs you deserve. Something always seems to come up. :)</p>

<p>I mean, in theory, anyone can work at McDonalds. But not everyone wants to, because they rather spend their time towards trying to gain actual work experience. And I'm not saying that there's no merit in working a Fast Food job, but training teenagers while earning minimum wage isn't what most people have in mind when they get a college degree. Hell, even people who are interested in culinary arts wouldn't utilize McDonalds because it doesn't make them look good. It might be better than being unemployed, but it's still McDonalds. Personally, I don't plan on freelancing forever. But until I begin running my own agency, I'm not going to see the point of working at McDonalds. I rather have a job that would serve as a helpful contact or reference on my resume. Relevancy to your background is key.</p>

<p>That is so true, they exploit people because they take jobs they either can't do or just don't want to.Then pay hard working freelancers who are struggling to get a review, their pennies or appropriately called "peanuts" to complete them. This should not have been allowed in the first place. Heaven can say what she wants, she is where she is and is now able, after a few years to dictate what happens in her savings account. Have a thought for those in third world countries and those who are just starting out. I am sure she did not start out where she is at right now.</p>

<p>There are lots of people who also speak from a place of privilege. I don't know Heather's life so I can't presume for her, but maybe Heather's never had to work a bad job to know what it's like. In that case, good for her. But it's not so good for the rest of us in this world that have had to slum it.</p>

<p>I have had to work bad jobs, to the point where I was working 14 hours a day just to make ends meet. That may not sound terrible for people who are used to labor intensive jobs, but don't underestimate the difficulties of the mental arts. Writing for more than a few hours straight gives me massive headaches...but that is all beside the point.</p><p>I am where I am because I have worked extremely hard to build a reputation online. I'm efficient with my time, communicative with my clients, active in my job hunts...etc. I don't think it's right for clients to pay pennies for jobs that are worth dollars, but at the same time, I don't think the sites hosting those jobs should be held accountable for them. It's the client who is choosing to hurt his employees, not the website.</p><p>The entire point of this debate was that freelancing is far from slavery, as Roland originally stated. It is a career choice that you just have to get through. If that means working for less than what you think you're worth at first, do it and get through it. Even a slow writer online can usually make more than minimum wage from the start - if he or she is active in finding work. Unpaid interns aren't considered slaves in the real world. Freelancers shouldn't be considered so on the internet. No offense, but it comes across as an excuse not to do well, rather than an opportunity to learn and grow.</p>

<p>I understand your point about freelancing not necessarily being slavery (If anything, the whole point of Freelancing is that it's anything but..) but what I'm trying to argue is that it's all semantics at this point. In our situation, we're Americans and we're also coming from a place of privilege: it's a lot easier for us to not trust any online job that tries to sell the allure of working offsite for pennies an hour, and for a reason: If you can't build any in-person connection, it's harder to trust the person who you're working for. And a lot of these people on sites like oDesk and Elance seem to not be real contacts but random folks in the middle of nowhere who want small projects . However, for someone in a developing country, I imagine that when they see these contracts in a country like America, they don't make that connection and assume that they're working for a real person. </p>

<p>I can understand that perspective. Even people in America who aren't familiar with the industry can get caught up in scams. I've probably lost a few thousand dollars worth of work from people who just chose not to pay me one day or who decided to drop their rates for no reason...without warning. Freelancing is far from the "right fit" for everyone, but it can be wonderful if you find a route that works for you. Some people just take longer to find that than others.</p>

<p>Oh Definitely! And heck, there's places here in the US that have fooled me too and made me believe they were legit. It's always the hardest pill to swallow when you realize you're in bad company. It's sad but after one too many bad clients, you're forced to develop business savvy fast in this field.</p>

<p>I couldn't agree more. I was actually lucky enough to find some great clients and a couple of ample-wage jobs but then suddenly from out of the blue oDesk permanently suspends me from using their platform. <br>I guess I was too classy for them.</p>

<p>oDesk is alright for those first projects/clients you need in your portfolio if starting out without diplomas(and provided you don't fall into traps like the one mentioned above, which happen like a million times a day on their site). Then it's time to leave the boat, figure out how to come outta the rat race with all your mind straight, fight daily stress, anxiety, low selfesteem, to be able to eventually find better paying gigs, that suit your skills better, with better clients. Otherwise you're in for hell, forget about being able to pay your bills like the others, forget about living a normal life, cut down on everything until you realize you got conned thinking you were doing your own business a favor. At that point you have only been pleasing a bunch of lowlives who don't even realize your potential. Now, oDesk has a nice gui yeah, and there is worse, there certainly is, that's the sad truth too. But they still are brokers in the field...of globalisation/neo_slavery. Be EXTRA-careful if you really plan to use sites like those.</p>

<p>It depends from person to person. I find oDesk as the best place to get projects. Now a days its getting difficult as the competition is increasing and skills resources are available at low cost. I never tried other sites like Elance.</p>

<p>Hi Ashwin,</p><p>I am from Mumbai, India. I am an editor with over four years of experience (as a full-time employee) in editing documents pertaining to various domains (business research, finance research, investment banking, company valuations, etc.). I intend to take up freelance editing from February 2014. Kindly guide me on how I can start with, and which will be the best place to find freelance editing jobs on the Internet. I just need a start, so that I can build a profile.</p><p>Many thanks for reading my query. I will be thankful if you share few words of advice in this regard.</p><p>Thanks,<br>Prabodh Phanse<br>India</p>

<p>An interesting article, although freelancing nowadays has become a quasi impossible job!  I used to make 20k/year with rentacoder (now bought by <a href="http://freelance.com/" rel="nofollow">Freelance.com</a>.), between 2000 and 2005.  Now, I haven't found ANYTHING for the last 6 months, or had to reject offers ready to pay 0.01$/hour...<br>On Freelance, 99% of job offers now end-up "expired" or "closed".  Each offer recieves 50+ bids from India (most of them Cur/Paste standard bull).<br>The economic climate does not help either...<br>Retiring from this world of madness... and taking care of MY OWN sites...</p>

<p>Have I wasted my time trying to get going with Yahoo! Contributors?  I've gotten about $4/article on a few upfront things, even though it seems their editors are a bit inconsistent (a news article about a new research study was rejected because they "don't accept personal narratives").  I'm a total beginner, though I'm pretty sure I'll do very good work if given the chance.</p>

<p>I don't like Yahoo either, to get something publish is a pain in the ass. They tend to desire specific articles, usually something that is bland and useless. If you attempt to write about an opposing view in politics, religion, government, employment etc compare to the standard media they reject your story immediately.</p>

<p>oDesk is also my favorite freelancing site because this is where I got my first job online. Writing as a career in the Philippines does not really come easy unless you are a Journalism or English lit. graduate. Even then, the pay may not be that great at all (our local newspaper pays $6 for a one-page story). Contrast that with what I earn at oDesk (some clients in the travel industry were willing to pay me $12 a page) and you can see why I have no time to look for jobs elsewhere. The key is to develop your craft, exceed client expectations, and stick to what you think you are worth. At my published hourly rate (which is equal to the minimum wage of California), most US/UK/Australian clients think they get a bargain, and so more business comes in.</p>

<p>Great article. I started experimenting a year ago with the oDesk-Elance-Freelancer triangle. In my experience it is the easiest to start picking up projects on Elance, with  the best ratio of clients vs. wannabies.</p><p>Look for posts which don't look too good to be true. You need clients who are able/willing to pay for work. To defend your self esteem crumbling away set your search criteria to exclude farmers with extreme low rates ;-)</p><p>I know only about hourlies (being a Virtual Assistant): best to negotiate the amount of expected hours and not the fees: started with 3-5 hrs/week projects. Now still with the first few clients, 5-30 hrs/week each.  My mantra was "don't do cheapo, you are a pro"</p>

<p>ODesk is a joke compared to other freelancing websites. They set ridiculous standards, don't encourage groups, and require lots of bulky software. Furthermore, the pricing is just ridiculously low. The clients expect you to design their entire branding campaign for peanuts.</p>

<p>I used to use RentaCoder where I earned pretty well. It turned vWorker after some times and finally Frelancer bought it.. Now I'm finding it really hard to get works and there are plenty of spams too... PS. SEOClerks is extremely hit. It's one of the most largest site online.</p>

<p>I'm glad you can find work on sites like Elance/oDesk but I have no luck with them. I charge a trivial $3 per 100 words and yet I'm still beat out by copy/pasted foreigners willing to take on a task for .50c per 100 words. Sure, the work may be spun garbage or incoherent but the majority of the clients on those sites just want everything for as cheap or as free as they can get it.</p><p>Honestly, having your own website and building up a reliable client list is the best way to make money in this business. Relying on job boards/forums and sites like Freelance will leave you hungry for more work. It's hard to obtain work when you're competing against hundreds if not thousands of writers willing to go lower than you.</p><p>Not to mention, a lot of the foreigners have "English Agents" that do interviews for them so you think you're getting a foreigner with great English, only to receive incomprehensible crap.</p>

<p>I'm with just-jr, rentacoder, which was renamed vWorker, was really great. Easy to use, easy to find work, and really steady. If I put in the hours, $2,000/mth off that site was no problem. Now that Freelancer bought it, it has been nothing but problems and I haven't had a single job. Stay far away from it. I had someone try to negotiate down from $0.01/word to $0.003/word. Are you kidding? The first was a bargain, the second was an insult.</p>

<p>Hi Heaven:</p><p>Thanks for the shout-out for Canadian Freelance Writing Jobs. We try to find quality gigs for Canadian freelance writers each weekday. I've used Odesk and Elance when I was starting out to build my portfolio, but find that I don't need them anymore now that I've built up a quality portfolio of work.</p>

<p>I like some of these, but was a bit disappointed to see Demand Studios on the list since they are notorious for paying ridiculously low wages. Content mills might be okay for brand new writers or people who are desperate, but not for professional writers.</p>

<p>I also started with oDesk for about 1 or 2 years I think until I got absorbed in the website where I am working for. It works for me and maybe for others as well but if you are looking for a gorgeous pay to begin your career, this is not your place. Instead, start your own company.</p>

<p>I dont understand the problem with low paid gigs. look at fiver, its based around cheep gigs. anyone gonna say its an evil site? All I ever read is people using shock words such as Slavery, Globalisation etc to try to add impact to a non existant argument. or so it would seem. can someone please make a good quality sound and intellegent argument as  to exactly why hiring someone for $1 an hour is in some way a problem?</p><p>other than that it makes life hard for the middle class that is.</p><p>In my mind at least its a new era, a new dawn, a new world. A world no one has ever needed to compete in before, a world where previously millions of excluded participants have now entered our areana. The world of global communication. so guess what, were here and we aint goin back so best buckle up and enjoy the ride cos its only the beggining of this thing.</p><p></p>

<p>O'desk is all bumph; Elance is overcrowded with people bidding the lowest allowed. Guru is complex navigation, but OK. PPH is far and away the best, paying 3 times as much for the same job. Ask me, I should know. I made $13,160 in 4 years with Elance and Euros 8,350 in ONE year at PPH. And I'm a freelancer. I write well too, so I'm generally an invitee.<br>NM</p>
